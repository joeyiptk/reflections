1. It can easily discover any difference between two files and further find out the errors or typos.

2. An easy access to the entire history of a file makes me serach and reference to pervious files and version more easily. It is certainly makes me work more efficient.

3. What do you think the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pro is I can keep track the versions and saving timeframe, but the con is I may forget to commit a new version.

4. What do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each files seperately?

I think it is smart.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I use git log first to find out the commit IDs and comments about changes, then I use git diff to further view the changes between different version.

6. How might using version control make your more confident to make changes that could break something?
